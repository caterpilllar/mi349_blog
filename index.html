      <p>Gaynor-Minden pointe shoes are a special type of point shoes that I used for two years. They are unique because they don't require any padding or support inside the shoe that would be typical for any other type of pointe shoes. I liked not needing to use any extra padding in my shoes because it made it faster to put them on. As well as being more efficient, it also helped me feel more grounded and balanced while dancing. Gaynor-Minden pointe shoes are also unique because they have a plastic internal sole instead of the traditional paper. This helps them bend and flex better and prevents them from breaking the way a more traditional pointe shoe would. Gaynor-Minden was not the first brand of pointe shoes I used, but it was the last, and my favorite. Each dancer is unique, which means that finding the right brand of pointe shoes is different for everyone. Gaynor-Minden was the brand for me.</p>

      <h3>turns vs jumps</h3>

      <p>Some dancers prefer turns, some prefer jumps; oftentimes the people that like turns dont care for jumps, and vice versa. I prefer jumps; they are easier for me due to the strength of my feet and therefore I think they're more fun. I tended to struggle with turns more, especially pirouettes. It requires precise balance and positioning; the smallest error can make the entire turn a failure. Men usually do more jumping than women; however I find the larger and traditionally more masculine jumps more fun. Some of my favorite grand jeté (big jumps) are the tour jeté and the grand pas de chat. However, I do like some turns. For example, the Italian fouetté is one of my favorites and I also like piqué turns. Turns and jumps are both very important in ballet because they are used in many variations. Even if a dancer has a preference for one or the other they must practice both in order to be able to do them both in performances. Although roles in performances are determined by a specific dancer's strengths, they are both widespread throughout all choreography.</p>
